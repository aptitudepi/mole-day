    ### Understanding the Mole
    In chemistry, a *mole* is a fundamental unit used to quantify the amount of a substance. It is defined by Avogadro's number, which is approximately 6.02214076 Ã— 10Â²Â³ particles.

    ### Significance of the Mole Concept
    The concept of the mole is crucial for chemists as it enables them to:
    - Conduct stoichiometric calculations with precision
    - Connect microscopic properties with macroscopic phenomena
    - Ensure consistency in chemical measurements
